Hola!!
This is an Android Contact Application. We have used Android Studio and Java. The App starts with a splash screen loading the app. The appliaction contains three fragments - CallHistory, Contacts and Favourites. The Call History displays 
the number, duration and date of calling. The contacts fragment has search option, add option and calling option. It displays all the contacts for a user. 
We have the functionality of displaying contact details. In this we have the favourite button which adds the contact to the favourite list and Delete button which deletes the contact.
The favourite fragment displays the favourite list. The Application uses Recycler view to display Contacts.
